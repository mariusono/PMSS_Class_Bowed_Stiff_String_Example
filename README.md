# PMSS_Class_Bowed_Stiff_String_Example
 Matlab and JUCE implementation of a bowed stiff string simulated using FDTD methds.
 
 The JUCE projects as is needs a Sensel morph. Also you would need to point XCode to the relevant location of the Sensel library on your machine. 
 
 Will try to add a mouse controlled application soon.
  
 Also the coding is very "quick and dirty" so not many comments and such..
